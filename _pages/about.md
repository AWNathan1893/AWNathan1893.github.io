### Hello!

You've reached my personal page. I will be a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville starting Fall 2024. My main interests lie at the intersection of geometry and topology, particularly the group theoretic aspects. A little more about me can be found [here](/about "about me"). You can find my blog _This doesn't seem right_ over [here](/blog "my blog"). The picture on the right is me standing on the rooftop of a building at ISI Bangalore in December 2023.

> What's the difference between a literalist and a kleptomaniac? One takes things literally, the other takes things, literally!

More of what I find funny can be found [here](/misc/jokes) :)

I am committed to making my work as accessible as possible, and I believe in Federico Ardila-Mantilla's axioms from [this article](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):

- Axiom 1: Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

- Axiom 2: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

- Axiom 3: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

- Axiom 4: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
