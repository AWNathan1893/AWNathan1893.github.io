### Hi!

This is my personal webpage, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and built with the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) template. I will be a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville starting Fall 2024. I am mainly interested in geometry and topology, particularly the group theoretic aspects. A little more about me can be found [here](/people "about me"). You can find my blog _This doesn't seem right_ over [here](/blog "my blog"); it's still empty but I plan on sharing interesting math I come across, as well as some thoughts about my non-mathematical interests.
