Hello! I'm Aaratrick[^1], a second year PhD student at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Thomas Koberda](https://sites.google.com/view/koberdat) and [Prof. Sara Maloni](https://sites.google.com/view/sara-maloni). I got my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Mathematics) from the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. I love discussing about whatever topic I am studying at the moment, and was fortunate to have had several opportunitities to give talks as an undergrad about some of them; some notes and slides can be found [here](/misc/notes). You can find more about my academics on [this](/cv/) page.

When I'm not thinking about math, you can probably find me tinkering with my dotfiles. I have also started (indoor) climbing since last Fall, and can currently climb routes of difficulty V2. I was an avid reader during my high school days, and am slowly getting back into that as well; I mostly read fiction (mainly crime and fantasy) and occasionally also poetry. I'm a big fan of jazz, Western classical and rock music, and I firmly believe in the following quote by RÃ©nyi, 

> A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.
