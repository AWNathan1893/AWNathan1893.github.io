Hello! I'm Aaratrick[^1], a first year PhD student at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. I got my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Mathematics) from the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. I am grateful to have had a wonderful peer group along with amazing instructors at ISI, for I would not know nearly half of the math I do currently without the people there! My mathematical interests lie at the intersection of geometry and topology; more specifically, I am interested in learning more about mapping class groups, hyperbolic manifolds and Teichmüller theory. I love discussing about whatever topic I am studying at the moment, and was fortunate to have had several opportunitities to give talks as an undergrad about some of them; some notes and slides can be found [here](/misc/notes). You can find more about my academics on [this](/cv/) page.

When I'm not thinking about math, you can probably find me tinkering with my dotfiles. I was an avid reader during my high school days, and am slowly getting back into that as well; I mostly read fiction (mainly crime and fantasy) and occasionally also poetry. I'm a big fan of jazz, Western classical and rock music, and I firmly believe in the following quote by Rényi, 

> A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.
