I have been reviewing basic algebra over this summer as preparation for my PhD quals, and took this opportunity to solve some problems from Isaacs's _Finite Group Theory_. All of the exercises in section 1C, which deals with the Sylow theorems, were reasonably easy, **except** for 1C4, which asks us to prove the statement given in the title. I felt quite good after actually solving this problem, and so I thought it would be apt to post my solution as the inaugural post for this blog.
